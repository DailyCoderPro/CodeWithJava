Let's dive into the topics you've requested.

### 1. **Operators in Java**

Operators in Java are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Java provides several types of operators:

#### **Arithmetic Operators**

These operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations.

- **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two values.
  ```java
  int sum = 5 + 3; // sum = 8
  ```
- **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts one value from another.
  ```java
  int difference = 5 - 3; // difference = 2
  ```
- **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two values.
  ```java
  int product = 5 * 3; // product = 15
  ```
- **Division (`/`)**: Divides one value by another.
  ```java
  int quotient = 10 / 2; // quotient = 5
  ```
- **Modulus (`%`)**: Returns the remainder of a division operation.
  ```java
  int remainder = 10 % 3; // remainder = 1
  ```
- **Increment (`++`)**: Increases a value by 1.
  ```java
  int x = 5;
  x++; // x = 6
  ```
- **Decrement (`--`)**: Decreases a value by 1.
  ```java
  int y = 5;
  y--; // y = 4
  ```

#### **Logical Operators**

Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions or to invert a condition's value.

- **AND (`&&`)**: Returns true if both conditions are true.
  ```java
  boolean result = (5 > 3) && (8 > 5); // result = true
  ```
- **OR (`||`)**: Returns true if at least one condition is true.
  ```java
  boolean result = (5 > 3) || (3 > 8); // result = true
  ```
- **NOT (`!`)**: Inverts the boolean value of a condition.
  ```java
  boolean result = !(5 > 3); // result = false
  ```

#### **Bitwise Operators**

Bitwise operators work on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations.

- **AND (`&`)**: Performs a binary AND.
  ```java
  int result = 5 & 3; // result = 1 (0101 & 0011 = 0001)
  ```
- **OR (`|`)**: Performs a binary OR.
  ```java
  int result = 5 | 3; // result = 7 (0101 | 0011 = 0111)
  ```
- **XOR (`^`)**: Performs a binary XOR (exclusive OR).
  ```java
  int result = 5 ^ 3; // result = 6 (0101 ^ 0011 = 0110)
  ```
- **NOT (`~`)**: Inverts all the bits of the operand.
  ```java
  int result = ~5; // result = -6 (inverts 0101 to 1010, which is -6 in two's complement form)
  ```
- **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Shifts the bits to the left.
  ```java
  int result = 5 << 1; // result = 10 (0101 << 1 = 1010)
  ```
- **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Shifts the bits to the right.
  ```java
  int result = 5 >> 1; // result = 2 (0101 >> 1 = 0010)
  ```

### 2. **Arithmetic Progression nth Term in Java**

An arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers in which the difference of any two successive members is a constant.

- **Formula for the nth term**:
  \[
  a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \times d
  \]
  where \(a_1\) is the first term, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(n\) is the term number.

#### **Example Code**:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a1 = 2; // first term
        int d = 3;  // common difference
        int n = 5;  // term number
        
        int nthTerm = a1 + (n - 1) * d;
        System.out.println("The " + n + "th term of the AP is: " + nthTerm);
    }
}
```

### 3. **Geometric Progression nth Term in Java**

A geometric progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.

- **Formula for the nth term**:
  \[
  a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)}
  \]
  where \(a_1\) is the first term, \(r\) is the common ratio, and \(n\) is the term number.

#### **Example Code**:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a1 = 3; // first term
        int r = 2;  // common ratio
        int n = 4;  // term number
        
        int nthTerm = (int)(a1 * Math.pow(r, n - 1));
        System.out.println("The " + n + "th term of the GP is: " + nthTerm);
    }
}
```
